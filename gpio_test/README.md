# GPIO test

This directory contains files to flash the Nucleo firmware to the Nucleo board,
check the GPIO configuration for the hold time violation type and flash a custom
firmware to caravel SoC.

It is taken from the [caravel board repository](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main)
(commit `0eb8c4c`) and has been modified by changing the directory
structure, cleaning up some files and add some functionality to improve the
usability. The core functionality is however not changed.

The directories contain the following:

- `build_custom_firmware`: A variation of `build_firmware_template`.
- `build_firmware_template`: A template directory for creating a custom firmware.
The original name in the source was `gpio_test`.
- `generated`: Some generated files needed for the RISC-V firmware. No changes
were made.
- `gpio_config`: Scripts and files needed for the GPIO configuration.
- `hw`: Only contains common.h.
- `nucleo_firmware`: All files needed to flash the Nucleo board.
- `riscv_firmware_src`: Files related to the RISC-V firmware for the caravel
SoC.
- `util`: Contains some scripts to interact with the caravel SoC when it is
  used without the Nucleo board.
